# Testing Print F String formatting

# Python3 program introducing f-string
val = 'Geeks'
print(f"{val}for{val} is a portal for {val}.")

age = 22
print(f"Hello, My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.")


# Prints today's date with help
# of datetime library
import datetime
today = datetime.datetime.today()
print(f"{today:%B %d, %Y}")

english = 78
maths = 56
hindi = 85
print(f"Ram got total marks {english + maths + hindi} out of 300")

# f-string expression part cannot include a backslash
# However, we can put the backslash into a variable as a workaround though:
newline = ord('\n')
print(f"newline: {newline}")
# We cannot use comments inside F-string expressions. It will give an error:
# f"GeeksforGeeks is {5*2 + 3 #geeks-5} characters."
# This will cause error

# Python String format() Method
# The format() method is a powerful tool that allows developers to create
# formatted strings by embedding variables and values into placeholders
# within a template string.

# Formatters are generally used to Organize Data.
# Formatters can be seen in their best light when

# If we are showing databases to users,
# using formatters to increase field size and
# modify alignment can make the output more readable.
